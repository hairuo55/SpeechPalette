In this paper, we present   <b>SpeechPalette</b>, a comprehensive speech editing method that allows users to easily modify various attributes of the selected speech segment according to their preferences, which includes text-based speech editing, one-shot TTS, pitch and speed rate adjustments, etc. 
</p> <p>This page shows the samples in the paper "<b>SpeechPalette: A Comprehensive High-quality Speech Editing Method for Text-based Speech Editing, One-shot TTS, and Attributes Editing</b>". </p> 
			<p>
			Experiments were based on <b>LibriTTS</b>. All <b>test samples and speakers</b> have not appeared in the training set and validation set.
